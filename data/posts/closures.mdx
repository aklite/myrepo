##### Hey I am glad you are here! Today in this Blog We will be learning about Closures in JavaScript.
## Basic Definition of Closure
*A function along with its lexical scope bundled together is called a closure* 

So what do we mean by lexical scope ü§î lexical 
scope means the place where the variable was created 

Chatting is okay lets chat with code üòÅ
```js
fucntion x() {
    var a=10 // local variable 
    function y() {
      console.log(a)
    }
    return y;
}
x() // 12
```

In the above code we have a function **x** within that we have another function **y**. 
Function **x** creates local variable and function **y** prints it to console. 

Function y dosen't have any local variable of its own but it 
has the access to local variable of its parent function 
**x** because of the Closure concept in JavaScript.

*Functions in JavaScript remember where were they created*. 
Function **y** stores a reference to the variable *a*. 

```js
fucntion x() {
    
    function y() {
      console.log(a)
    }
    var a=10 // local variable 
    a++;
    return y;
}
x() // 11 
```

It dosen't matters where do we declare the variables. When the function is 
created in the call stack then and there itself variables get declared. 

Numerous Output questions can be formed on the basis of Closures concept. 

That's it for this blog!!

I hope you learnt something from my Blog!

Thank you!! üòÅ
