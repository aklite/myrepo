##### Hey ya In this blog We will learn about Conditional Rendering in ReactJS 

Single Page applications are dynamic and event driven in nature. To make this possible
React has one feature called ***conditional rendering***.
Wait what do you mean by *rendering* ?
By Rendering we mean to say that updating the page view based on changes in its state or props.


React components need to often display different user interface based on different conditions. 

This concept is often applied in different situations: 
- Rendering external data from an API 
- Showing or hiding elements
- Toggling application feature
- implementing permission levels 
- Handling authentication and authorization 

Lets see some ways of implementing conditional rendering in ReactJS 

## Method 1
In Some situations we may not want to render anything at all. In that case we can return `null`

```jsx
if (condition){
    return <div>{name}<div>;
}
return null;
```

If condition is true, it will return JSX to render, or else it returns null
Its not common to return null from component.

## Method 2 using ternary operator `?`

```jsx 
return (
    <div>
      {condition ? name + ' ✔' : name}
    </div> 
)
In the above code if condition is true (` ? `)
then render `name + '  ✔`', or else ( : ) render `name`

## Method 3 using Logical AND operator ( `&&` )
```jsx
return (
    <div>
    {name} {condition && '✔'} 
    </div>
)
```
JavaScript && expression returns the value of its right side
if the lift side (condition) is true. But if the condition on left side is false 
the whole expression becomes false, and dosen't render anything in its place. We shouldn't put numbers on the left
side of `&&` .JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is `0`, then the whole expression gets that value (0), and React will happily render 0 rather than nothing.

## Conditionally assigning JSX to a variable 
The above 3 methods were shortcuts if theat becomes tricky or hard to use,
we can use `if` statement and a variable. You can 
reassign variables defined with let  

```
let itemContent=name;
```
Use an `if` statement to reassign a JSX expression to itemContent if 
`isPacked` is `true`
```
if (isPacked) {
  itemContent = name + " ✔";
}
```

Curly braces open the “window into JavaScript”. 
Embed the variable with curly braces in the returned JSX tree, 
```jsx
<li className="item">
  {itemContent}
</li>
```


Final code 
```jsx
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  let itemContent = name;
  if (isPacked) {
    itemContent = (
      <del>
        {name + " ✔"}
      </del>
    );
  }
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {itemContent}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```
