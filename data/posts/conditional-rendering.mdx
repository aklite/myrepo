##### Hey ya In this blog We will learn about Conditional Rendering in ReactJS 

Single Page applications are dynamic and event driven in nature. To make this possible
React has one feature called ***conditional rendering***.

React components need to often display different user interface based on different conditions. 

This concept is often applied in different situations: 
- Rendering external data from an API 
- Showing or hiding elements
- Toggling application feature
- implementing permission levels 
- Handling authentication and authorization
