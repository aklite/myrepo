### My learnings from making my Portfolio
- I learnt about SSG (Static Site Generation) from [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/)
- Static Site Generation (SSG) decreases page loadtime because url path and the data gets pre-rendered and implemented all this in my site.
- I learnt about Static Site Rendering (SSR) is used when the data changes frequently. 
- SSG should be used while making Blogging site, Documentation 
- SSR should be used in Social media apps. Chatting web-apps. 
- Benifits of pre-rendering are that even if the our site's backend's server isn't working due to any of the arbitary reasons our site our site would be still ready to use.
- I learnt how to use typescript in my React based projects. To learn typescript I used sometimes `typescript` [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and  freecodecamp's [youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/30LWjhZzg50)
- I knew how to use Tailwind in my projects. Got even better with it while making this portfolio.
- I learnt Open Graph which is made by facebook, to preview my site in social media.

### What would I do next using my portfolio
- I would write good reliable technical blogs.
- starting a news letter for my blogs. 
- Implement backend server for my portfolio to fetch views, post comments, reactions to my blogs.
